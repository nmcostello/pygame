# pygame

this is a repo for the boot.dev project using pygame. i'm using it
to learn python deeper, learn a little about game programming and learn
some OOP stuff.

i haven't really done much with OOP since university so it's a nice
little exercise to get the juices flowing again.

i might try to make a game in go after this. i could clone this one, who knows.

stay tuned :)

- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
